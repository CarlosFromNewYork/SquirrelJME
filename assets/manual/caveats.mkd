# Caveats

These are caveats for SquirrelJME. Anything listed here is an intended design
and is not a bug.

# Garbage Collection

For simplicity the garbage collector is a reference counter with sweeping when
no more memory is available (or GC is called manually). As such, cyclic
object references will not be freed unless one or both directions are
weakly referenced (using `WeakReference`).
