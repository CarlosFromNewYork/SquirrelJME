Actually, when it comes to what a specific kind of register is I can have it
variable as needed. For example, I might not need 64 integer registers, but
I might need 72 floating point registers. Then at least I will have a more
Java purposed instruction set so to speak. I can have 5 types of registers:

 * int
 * long
 * float
 * double
 * reference
