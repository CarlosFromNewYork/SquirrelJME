Up early today.

Well, the new class path splitting is much more concise.

Appears my ZIP file reading is not correct somehow.

## 07:41

Actually it is failing because you can open a directory in a `FileChannel`. At
least on Linux. So when running on Linux there would just be an extra exception
that prints because of this.

## 07:57

It is undocumented and opening directories fails on other operating systems, so
I am not going to duplicate it even on Linux.

I am currently away and have no internet connection and I am using another
computer. However I might not have the APPNOTE.TXT file which contains the
ZIP specification.

## 15:45

So I cannot implement ZIP files right now since I lack the details.

## 15:50

The good thing about fossil however is that it is a DVCS so I have all the
revisions and I can commit locally. With SVN I would need the internet to do
any real work.
