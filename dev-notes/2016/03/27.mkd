Operator links should stop at TOP also and treat those the same as NOTHING.

Yes, I know how I can do it with checking and such. For an atom I can have
a derivation of the current atom. This essentially clones the current atom (not
using `clone()`) where its state can be freely modified and operator chains
used as such. Then once the code runs and sets the state, the future atom for
the next instruction (or any jumping points) can be set to copy the state of it
so that at the entry of the instruction, the state is known. The derivation
however has to have the correct position and the code has to know its it one.
