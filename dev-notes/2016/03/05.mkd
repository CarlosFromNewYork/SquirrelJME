Appears the Arduino has had a troubling history associated with it. In other
parts, today I have to perform my refactoring of the ZIP code so I can share it
more between the 32-bit and 64-bit variants and have less code. Currently as
it stands it is a bit ugly.

I should probably be more descriptive in my exceptions even though they would
be english only for the most part.

My directory entries could just be map entries, that would simplify some things
a bit. I can also have directory initialization based on the position of the
table, so basically entries in the ZIP are a table of long values. Searching
for specific entries would require linear traversal over the map however.
