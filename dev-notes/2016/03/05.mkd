Appears the Arduino has had a troubling history associated with it. In other
parts, today I have to perform my refactoring of the ZIP code so I can share it
more between the 32-bit and 64-bit variants and have less code. Currently as
it stands it is a bit ugly.

## 13:02

I should probably be more descriptive in my exceptions even though they would
be english only for the most part.

## 14:54

My directory entries could just be map entries, that would simplify some things
a bit. I can also have directory initialization based on the position of the
table, so basically entries in the ZIP are a table of long values. Searching
for specific entries would require linear traversal over the map however.

## 14:57

I could actually sub-class exceptions. Instead of a message saying whatever,
I can instead just have a sub-class extension. So if a ZIP directory was not
found then the exception is called with the reason. This means that I can go
easier on strings a bit at the cost of adding classes.

## 16:40

Well my current recursive map ZIP format is a bit insane, so I need to fix that
up a bit.

Ok, what I actually need next is a kind of class path element that is common
to the interpreter. So essentially the interpreter engine knows about there
being a class path, but internal details are a bit hidden away. Classes which
extend it could use it and such. I also have to have it abstract enough so that
a compiler system could be written using the pre-existing interpreter parsing
of sorts.

## 19:50

This would also be helpful with the compiler so it can determine where packages
are and such also.

## 19:58

I should add that this is the native compiler.
