Today is also going to be a busy real life day. So what I need to work on next
is figuring out decompression and such. So what I first need is an input stream
that can be used in any position in the ZIP. So the base class works. This
would then be used for the stored stream or passed into the soon to be
deflator.

Would be the inflator.

`ZipFormatException` has to be renamed to something more generic with all of
the inner classes residing in it.

I could use the extra IO stuff in another project. Then I can use that for
example with CRC32 or a size limited input stream.
