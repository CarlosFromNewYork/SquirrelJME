Perhaps later today I can figure out ZIP files. I suppose the next thing I will
do is just do a massive dump of the central directory tables to attempt to see
if there is any sane way to determine how large a local file is along with its
header.

Perhaps what I can do to limit the massive number of constants that I have in
the ZIP code for all of the offsets, I can do a typesafe kind of enumeration
structure reference based on an input pointer. Doing it this way I can then
have all the fields defined in an enumeration which can handle the type. Then
I could perform a read on those fields and use long/int/short/byte as required.
That would be easier to debug because I could just read and print them without
giant print statements with constants. It would also probably be less prone to
bugs because then the field being requested would be known.

Actually realization, I suppose a stressful day yesterday was messing with my
thinking. Anyway, I can determine the size of the zip by using the local file
offsets. Note that these can appear in any order, so I get them all first and
have it so I know which values belong to what. I then sort all of them to
determine their logical placement in the file. Then using that I can determine
how large the actual ZIP is. One thing I would have to handle though is
polyglots and situations where local file indexes are in the contents of
stored entries. So also with this I am going to go into the structured enum
form so I do not have to rely on adding with constants. Then I am going to fix
my code around that, then perform the required calculation to determine the
actual ZIP size. The good thing with the ZIP format is that there is the offset
to the start of the central directory start which will be useful. Also
currently I use the central directory size to determine where it starts from
the end. So doing both of these will end up with clean code and should result
in working ZIP code. I have been working on this ZIP code for 6 days, and
hopefully after this I just need to get the decompression algorithms
implemented and then I can continue with loading classes.

Was a busy outside real life day today. However I do know what I want to do.
First I will write the structure code so I can have a safer way to access the
raw ZIP data without potentially falling into bugs and such.
