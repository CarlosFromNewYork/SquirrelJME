Perhaps later today I can figure out ZIP files. I suppose the next thing I will
do is just do a massive dump of the central directory tables to attempt to see
if there is any sane way to determine how large a local file is along with its
header.

Perhaps what I can do to limit the massive number of constants that I have in
the ZIP code for all of the offsets, I can do a typesafe kind of enumeration
structure reference based on an input pointer. Doing it this way I can then
have all the fields defined in an enumeration which can handle the type. Then
I could perform a read on those fields and use long/int/short/byte as required.
That would be easier to debug because I could just read and print them without
giant print statements with constants. It would also probably be less prone to
bugs because then the field being requested would be known.
