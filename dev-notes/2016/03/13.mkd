I actually do not need to use the descriptor because that is only really needed
during streams. It is also placed after the compressed data. This means I need
a reference to the directory offset that a file belongs to for the obtaining
of the size.

It is also really only used for streaming deflate compression since writing
and seeking back may be impossible, so the checksum and the actual sizes of
the data is not known at all. This makes perfect sense.
