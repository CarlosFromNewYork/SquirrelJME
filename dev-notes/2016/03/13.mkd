I actually do not need to use the descriptor because that is only really needed
during streams. It is also placed after the compressed data. This means I need
a reference to the directory offset that a file belongs to for the obtaining
of the size.

It is also really only used for streaming deflate compression since writing
and seeking back may be impossible, so the checksum and the actual sizes of
the data is not known at all. This makes perfect sense.

For dynamic huffman, I need another sample input which is a bit larger.

The later big data tests would be better as hex data in resources, that way it
does not complicate the class code.
