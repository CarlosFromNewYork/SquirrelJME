I suppose I can have a single class for variable states, I could also just
merge the stack and locals into one single list so that the visible state of
all operations are combined as one. I would only have to maintain a single
state, but it would have to be able to handle the stack and such. It would
have to be like my old one, where variable types and such are implicit.
Although this time instead of being actually existing and forced into memory
it is instead cached fully.
