Refactor is going well, things are much nicer now.

## 00:20

First day of spring also.

## 15:21

This refactored code is much simpler now and likely much faster too.

## 15:57

I believe I have a short or too long of a read somewhere.

## 16:04

Based on the dump and the values I am seeing, I am short two bytes.

## 16:07

And looking at the hex dump of the class, those missing two bytes are for
the ignored attribute, since the length is an integer and not an unsigned
short.

## 16:15

Method handles will require slightly more complex work to make them
cachable because identifiers can contain `(` and `)`. They are also not in
fixed positions. So I suppose what I will do then is have a fixed offset and
length similar to the binary name, then substring as required.
