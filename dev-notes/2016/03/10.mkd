Up early.

Only about a month left for that Creator CI40 KickStarter, it will be pretty
nice to obtain those boards as I can do development on them.

I believe in my implementation of the JVM I am going to limit the maximum
number of loaded classes to 65,536. Basically classes would be referenced by
a two byte index. I could also reduce the class count and use the upper bits
for some special details potentially. I will probably need a flag to indicate
if something is a ROM class or a RAM class, so I suppose the upper bit would
work. So that means 32,768 built-in classes and 32,768 loadable classes. Since
Java ME only has a single class path, every built-in class will already be
loaded so to speak. That is the CLDC and everything else will be part of the
binary.

I am going to probably need JSR 177 for `MessageDigest` and such.

I believe I need a tester for the inflate algorithm with known input for
example, this way I know what to expect.

## 14:31

The internal `__escape` method in the test would probably be better if it did
not rely on `StringBuilder` as I am removing it right now. This way there is
no intermediary string to work with for example.

## 15:27

Never actually used huffman before. My literal representation check works to
make sure that the mask is always of the lowest mask value.
