All of the invoke operations are essentially the same and since I do not have
to handle `invokedynamic` at all, I do not have to worry about the complexities
that it brings to the virtual machine.

## 16:41

The interface method reference would probably be best as a method, I do have to
check them if an interface is used however.

## 17:33

Stack overflow and underflow would probably best throw an exception which is
of a virtual machine exception.

## 17:50

The derivation fallback for the state of operations must not destroy the top
of stack elements unless perhaps a specific flag is set.

## 17:58

For method calls which return no result, I will still need to generate a
method call for it. Thus the atom will need an operator link itself.
