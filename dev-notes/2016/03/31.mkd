If you look at the jump target for instructions, you can notice loops and such.

Thinking about it, I could have exceptions done separate from the jump sources.
Then I can have a union list and cache it when exception data is loaded. This
will reduce the complication that would be required when handling such things.
The jump targets and jump sources would get additions to them. This would work
out since I only have to worry about exceptions later on.
