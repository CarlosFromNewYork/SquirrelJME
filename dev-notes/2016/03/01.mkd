Actually, I need to use `FileChannel` because I need random access to the class
files and such. However JavaME's `FileChannel` is rather light. I however can
just make a wrapper interface of sorts though. Or the alternative when reading
from a `SeekableByteChannel` would be to lock it, perform the read, then unlock
at a slight speed reduction. I cannot extend `FileChannel` because that would
end up with an incompatible class.
