This initial value I have is rather difficult when it comes to elimination.

Actually, I could use what I have now as a kind of heuristic and have a spliced
off huffman tree which is in four parts. That would reduce the runtime memory
requirement so to speak. I would need to be in all active trees at the same
time however. If a rover falls off the tree then it is not that route. If I
were to visuallize the entire huffman tree and its routes.
