Brute force can work.

This initial value I have is rather difficult when it comes to elimination.

Actually, I could use what I have now as a kind of heuristic and have a spliced
off huffman tree which is in four parts. That would reduce the runtime memory
requirement so to speak. I would need to be in all active trees at the same
time however. If a rover falls off the tree then it is not that route. If I
were to visuallize the entire huffman tree and its routes.

I would not need a tree if I made a gigantic method which does comparisons on
all of the tree values. So basically it would just consist of branches. Then
it could exist in the ROM. I do wonder how big such a method would be though
since there are byte code limitations.
