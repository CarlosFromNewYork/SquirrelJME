And the build system is complete. I will have to get it running on Windows and
write a batch script for that either before I sleep or after I awaken.

And I wrote up a shell script, do not know if it works however.

And the script works in Wine, I lack a real Windows system however so I cannot
truly see if it works in Windows. However Wine generally is good enough.
