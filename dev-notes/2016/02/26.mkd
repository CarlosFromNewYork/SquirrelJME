This is my start of SquirrelJME which is similar to SquirrnixME except it is
under the AGPLv3+ and has pretty much the same intended goals.

For specific systems I am going to need to use `near`, `far`, and such. For
example the Zilog Z80 compiler uses `near`, `far`, and `rom`. `rom` addresses
the built in memory since normally the hardware does not have a unified address
space for accessing read-only data and in memory data.
