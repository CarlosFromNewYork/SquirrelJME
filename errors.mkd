# Error Codes

Error codes consist of ASCII characters and are limited to 4 characters. The
first two characters are the prefix, followed by a base-36 index starting from
`00` and ending at `zz` indicating the sub-type of the message. The first two
characters should be uppercase while the index should be lowercase.

# General Codes

These codes do not have a index meaning and are meant to be short.

 * `TODO` -- Incomplete code.
 * `NARG` -- Null arguments passed to method.
