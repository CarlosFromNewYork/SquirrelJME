# Legal

I am not a lawyer, however is this software even legal to write? With the
very recent occurence of _Oracle vs Google_ some confusing things may appear.
Traditionally, APIs could be copied by developers meaning to create a fully
compatible implementation of that given API under fair use rules. However
Google with Android copied a considerable portion of the Java APIs and created
the incompatible Android. However with this software myself, I intend to be
100% compatible with Java ME 8 as released by Oracle.
