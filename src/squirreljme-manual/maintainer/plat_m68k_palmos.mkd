# Motorolla 68000: Palm OS

# Cooperative or Preemptive?

I do know that Palm OS 5 is preemptive, however I do not know about older
versions of Palm OS.

# Alarms

Alarms could be used if there is no preemptive multi-tasking to simulate a
preemptive call. Basically when an alarm is called it can launch the program
which then performs the proper dispatching and such.
