/**
 * This is a class which provides the ability to create {@link UIDisplay}s as
 * needed to interact and show information to the user. A display manager can
 * create multiple displays at the same time, however there may be limitations
 * as to the number of displays which are active at any one time. For example,
 * on modern desktop systems there may be a single window for each unique
 * display, while on a mobile device there might only be just a single display
 * at a time.
 *
 * This is the class which is provided in inter-process objects by the UI
 * manager process for the creation of displays and such.
