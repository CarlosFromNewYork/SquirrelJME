Thinking about it, namespaces can be in their own sections so to speak as part
of the ELF.

I just thought that the unaligned ELF could include the entire ELF. Which
is does `0x000000` in one of the hello binaries. So I could technically use
this to my advantage and just include the entire ELF in the program. This
would mean that I would not need to have a bunch of padding everywhere and
can still keep the ELF rather simple.
