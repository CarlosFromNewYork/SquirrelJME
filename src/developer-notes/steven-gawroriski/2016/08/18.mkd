Ok so my squashed down data is done, I just need to start implementing the
code generator.

Currently 20KiB, not writing the end of class magic number gives me 19KiB. This
is likely the lowest I can go without compressing resources. One thing I can do
to reduce the size (an average of 2 bytes per class) would be to make the
super class implicit and instead sort the class entries by super class, but
that would be rather complex to do.
