`remove` is just a `get` followed by a `delete`. This way I need not worry
about reading bytes. Then I can add `delete` which is capable of deleting a
range of data without using it (could be useful).

To make it so deletion is simpler and does not require position updates for
each chunk, the deletion can be performed from the higher position to the
lower one.
