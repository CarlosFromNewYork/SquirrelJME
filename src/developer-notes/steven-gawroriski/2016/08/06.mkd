So now I have 1899912 in 95 seconds, which is about 20KiB/s which is a minor

What I can do for DPIS is make it so the bytes are offered first before
reading. Currently it tries to read, then fills it. If I offer first then there
would be less of a chance of the pipeline stalling.

Drain before gives me 100 seconds, I will run it again.

Now it gives 88 seconds which gives me about 22KiB/s.
