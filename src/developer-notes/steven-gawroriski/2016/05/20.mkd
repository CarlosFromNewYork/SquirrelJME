So I suppose for archives, I need a kind of data accessor of sorts. Actually,
if all archives are shared and cached and with my current layout of them
containing classes, resources and other such things might be cachable. I am
going to add a bridge of sorts so that in the future I could potentially cache
any kind of resource for example.
