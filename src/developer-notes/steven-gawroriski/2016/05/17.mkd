I woke up around 5 or so this morning.

I am going to use monitors such as `wait` and `notify` for the event handling.
This is a situation where it would be quite handy to do so.

## 09:14

I believe I am going to move the implementation down so that it is not
`kernel` but `kernel.impl` instead. Otherwise operating systems and
architectures could conflict with packages that exist in `kernel`.
