Actually my previous times are invalid because I had more packages available
while right now due to a reboot my built package cache has been cleared.

 * 4.0s
 * 2.4s
 * 2.3s
 * 2.4s
 * 2.4s

So due to there being less packages, it is definitely much faster. However two
seconds is still a bit slow.
