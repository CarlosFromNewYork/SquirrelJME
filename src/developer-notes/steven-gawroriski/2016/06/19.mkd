I believe I know what is wrong with my merge sort. I am swapping the output
with the lowest sorted value then I skip over it. I must not do that.

The merge sort with the stack that I have is a bit complex, it can really just
be done with a single pivot that splits the left and right sides.

Pivots would be even more complex.
