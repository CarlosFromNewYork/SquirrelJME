Still no electric, running on battery power. Luckily for me I can mount my PDA
and sync against it so that the most up top date code is on my PDA. I have
about an hour of battery. So my plan yesterday was no refactor the ZIP code
so that it is a bit faster and does not rely on the structures and the reading
in general is a bit faster and more multi-threaded friendly.
