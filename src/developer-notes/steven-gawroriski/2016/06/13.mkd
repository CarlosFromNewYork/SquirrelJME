I need an efficient way to describe the structure of classes and objects so
that they may be allocated by the structure manager.

The information of what a current class is and the identity hash code will not
be special outside details, they will just be standard fields within a class
that are initialized to values on allocation.

`String` has `valueOf` and `copyValueOf`.
