The operations will need a list of externals that it accesses.

## 08:41

What could help is a raw operation map which just has the operation code and
the input values passed to it.

Then I can use interpretations of the raw argument data with a kind of data
interpreter.

I can switch the explicit verification states to use an array where the states
are binary searched instead of using a map.
