The configuration would best be immutable for the most part. This way it could
more easily be used when threads and such need to be created.

However, perhaps just an immutable class that can be initialized.

For a mutable variant I can just use a kind of builder.

I need better names for the CPUs in the builder. I will go with the planned
variants.

So when it comes to building, I need a JIT that could cache and provide native
executable code fragments for classes and such.
