According to the rules of the virtual machine, final fields for instances can
only be set if the current method is called `<init>`. The same goes for statics
except for `<clinit>`. There is actually a bug in JamVM, the spec says that
only `invokespecial` may call the initializers, however that VM permits those
instructions from calling the initializers.
