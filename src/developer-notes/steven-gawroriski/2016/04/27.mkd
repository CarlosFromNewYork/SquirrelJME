I wonder how valid it would be for `newarray` and `anewarray` to return the
same object if an attempt is made to allocate an array of zero length for a

Time to start delving into the native code generation and SSA stuff since I

native compiler core so that the code generator and parsers are in separated
parts along with the personalities split apart.
