Actually the using of exceptions is much simpler because there is no `O(n^2)`
work required at all, it is just the number of exceptions which are available.

I could keep the SSA states simple by having it be input based rather than
both input and output based. The input of a target instruction is the output
of the source instruction's input. For example, there could be some work that
is performed and then a `return` is reached making that work pointless.
