I can actually use GCJ to compile the stuff to byte code interestingly. GCJ
appears to just completely ignore the version identifier. However, since
Java ME is essentially Java 5 in that it has nothing that makes it require
Java 7, it works regardless. Language features such as `AutoCloseable` and
such are just syntactic sugar on top of the byte code.
