It is possible that I could merge `CPProgram` and `CPProgramBuilder` together
into a single class. However, it would be slightly complicated.

I could also separate the local interpreter since I may want the basic
interpreter to be branched off. I already designed it to be separated though,
so I should keep it that way. It is possible that I may want to reuse it for
example in a hypothetical IDE or hairball to build itself and generate a binary
for another target.

Also due to the way the new class loading code works, there will no longer be
any partial classes.
