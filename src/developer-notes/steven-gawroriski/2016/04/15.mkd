Going to split off part of the constant pool stuff and make those into other
classes so it is a bit cleaner.

## 08:31

Ok so today:

 * Refactor and split about the constant pool entry stuff.
 * Move any gigantic case switch stuff out from `CPOp` and similar (such as
   argument get and a few other things) into another helper class.
