The JITTarget can use a simplified output which is matched to operating system
packages. Instead of just say `powerpc32.linux.generic` the targets will
essentially be `powerpc-32,big.linux.generic`. However since some packages
might support some bits and others not, there would essentially be a list of
stuff rather than just having single entries.
