I need to fix the simulator so that instead it is a service based interface
which provides operating system support based on architectures and such
instead of not as concrete sets of data. Get rid of all the providers and just
have a `SimulationProvider` which can create simulations as such.

The simulation such as architecture variants can be linked to the JIT for
simplicity.
