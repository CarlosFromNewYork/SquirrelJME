One thing that I will need to handle in the virtual file system manager would
be to have access to directories via perhaps listing contents. For example if
one mounts to `/foo` then a content listing of `/` should list `foo` even if
there is a virtual handler which is mounted to `/` and has no actual files
associated with it.
