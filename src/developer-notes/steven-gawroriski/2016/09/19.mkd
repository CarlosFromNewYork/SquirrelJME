I would say for projects, I will need a way to list their contents in a way
that is managed by the information class. Basically a `ProjectDirectory` which
can be referenced. It would likely be best if it were `Closeable` where each
directory request is unique.

However, this code will likely be shared with the actual Java compiler I would
write in the future, to interact with it that is. As such, it should be treated
as such.
