# PowerPC 32-bit: Mac OS (9)

# Different Directory Separator

MacOS's directory separator is `:` (colon). This makes it a bit odd out of the
bunch since before that was the case, the OS had no actual directories.

# Cooperating Tasking

The OS is cooperatively tasked, although there may be multi-threading.

# Development

Since Mac OS 9 is quite dated, getting information from it may be difficult.
