LIBlet-Name: OpenGL ES Software Rasterizer
LIBlet-Vendor: Steven Gawroriski
LIBlet-Version: 0.0.2
LIBlet-Description: This contains an implementation of OpenGL ES 
 which is completely backed by a software rasterizer. The purpose 
 of the software rasterizer is to have a fallback in the event that 
 hardware acceleration is not available. Because it is a software 
 rasterizer, it utilizes the CPU and as such it may cause overhead 
 when drawing. The software rasterizer does not care about the type 
 of display that is used, since it relies only on the Graphics 
 instance.
